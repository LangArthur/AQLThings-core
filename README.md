# AquilonThings #
_A Minecraft Bukkit plugin framework for modular functionnalities oriented towards roleplay servers_

## About ##
This project provides a framework to quickly develop new plugin features for minecraft servers.

It was originally developed for the specific purpose of *aquilon-mc.fr* minecraft server.
Since it has closed down the choice was made to render the code publicly available so that it can be used by others.

This project remains actively developed and new features are often added.
If you would like to contribute please let us know by opening an issue, and we will gladly help you get started.

As of now the project still severely lacks documentation. In an effort to help user get started with the project
we recently started redacting a proper documentation. Feel free to help us out.

Some parts of the code might be in French since it was initially developed in this language.

## Main concepts ##
This plugin relies on a modular system.
The core plugin provides the framework and each module add its own functionality.

Modules can be dependent on each other and can use other plugins.

Currently all modules are contained within a single JAR file
however a dynamic module loading system is being developed.
